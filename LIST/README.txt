LIST 0.1 beta

LIST 0.1 beta generates Position Conservation Matrixes for human protein sequences in fasta format.
- First, input sequences are aligned to the UniProt Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL
- Then, it computes a deleteriousness value for every possible AA mutation in the sequence based on the LIST algorithm.

Minimum hardware requirement:
Ubuntu platform running on a desktop computer with at least 16G RAM, and a 4 cores CPU. Disk IO is the main performance bottleneck, thus SSD is recommended.

To install and test LIST 0.1 beta

Install the blast alignment tools, please type:
 sudo apt-get install ncbi-blast+

Unzip the LIST.zip file.

from: https://www.uniprot.org/downloads/ Download into the UniProt directory:
Reviewed (Swiss-Prot) fasta and Unreviewed (TrEMBL) fasta

from: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/ Download into the Taxa directory:

To compile source code, please type:
make

To unpack and format downloaded data files, type
make unpack
               processing time is 1~3 hours

To run the test sequences in the data directory, please type:
./list data

Running LIST 0.1
LIST 0.1 processes all fasta sequences in the target directory. Each sequence must be in a fasta format in a separate file with the extension ‘.fast’.

NCBI blastp is used for alignment using m threads (default m = 4). To use different n and m values, include these values in the command line:
./list dir [threads_cnt]

Example:
./list data 2
Process all sequences in the data directory using 2 threads.
